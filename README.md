# presentations

Here I will keep some presentations…

## How to work?

1. Visit `./playground` folder, and see how index.html works.

1. Copy the whole folder and start a new presentation work!

1. `cd __FOLDER__; source ./start.sh`

1. Change the `<title></title>` in `index.html` file

1. Edit `markdown.md`

1. Optional: enable more plugins

Also, to avoid some build and other stuff, better to get dependencies from here: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/reveal.js/4.4.0

## I need more features!

To enable other plugins better to see full setup and official docs

In addition to have more examples to run and play around you can do it with cloning the reveal.js about rich details <https://revealjs.com/installation/#full-setup>

That's all what I need to write about for now… Have fun!

## Fast charge with ADHD content

* For gifs, use <https://tenor.com/> or <https://giphy.com/> (giphy is not friendly with embed IMHO)
* For processes, use <https://stately.ai/registry/new>
* For video, use Mac OS screen recording (ur on windows? Oh, I dont have it sorry… there must be an alternative) and its imidiatelly embedable
* For content alignhment, use official reveal.js [examples](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/master/examples)
* … TBD
